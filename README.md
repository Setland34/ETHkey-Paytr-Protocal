## FAQ
### What is the Paytr protocol?
The Paytr protocol is designed to facilitate secure and efficient transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.

### How do I deploy the smart contracts?
Follow the instructions in the [Usage Instructions](#usage-instructions) section.

## Troubleshooting
### Common Issues
- **Error: VM Exception while processing transaction:** Ensure that you have enough gas for the transaction.
- **Error: Contract not deployed:** Make sure you have run the migration script.

### Debugging Tips
- Use the Truffle console to interact with the deployed contracts and debug issues.
- Check the transaction logs for any errors or warnings.

## Detailed Usage Examples
### Interacting with Deployed Contracts
1. Open the Truffle console:
   ```
   truffle console
   ```
2. Interact with the deployed contracts:
   ```javascript
   const instance = await Paytr.deployed();
   const result = await instance.someFunction();
   console.log(result);
   ```

### Real-World Scenario
1. Integrate the smart contracts with a frontend application using web3.js or ethers.js.
2. Call different functions and handle responses in the frontend application.

## Integrating with Frontend Application
1. Set up a frontend application using a framework like React or Angular.
2. Use web3.js or ethers.js to interact with the deployed smart contracts.
3. Call functions and handle responses in the frontend application.

## Testing Smart Contracts
1. Write tests in the `test/` directory.
2. Run tests using the following command:
   ```
   truffle test
   ```
