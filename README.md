## Description
This repository contains the smart contracts for the ETHkey protocol. The ETHkey protocol is designed to facilitate secure and efficient transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Cloning the Repository
To clone this repository, use the following command:
```
gh repo clone Setland34/ETHkey-1
```

## Installing Dependencies
To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:
```
npm install
```

## Deployment Instructions
To deploy the smart contracts, follow these steps:
1. Compile the contracts:
```
truffle compile
```
2. Deploy the contracts to the development network:
```
truffle migrate --network development
```
3. If deploying to a testnet or mainnet, update the `truffle-config.js` file with the appropriate network configuration and run:
```
truffle migrate --network <network-name>
```

## Testing Instructions
To run tests for the smart contracts, use the following command:
```
truffle test
```
For running tests with forked mainnet state, use the command:
```
forge test --fork-url https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOURKEY
```

## API Documentation
The API documentation provides detailed information about the functions and methods available in the smart contracts. [Link to API Documentation](#)

## Development Environment Setup
To set up the development environment, follow these steps:
1. Install Node.js and npm.
2. Install Truffle and Ganache CLI globally:
```
npm install -g truffle ganache-cli
```
3. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```
gh repo clone Setland34/ETHkey-1
cd ETHkey-1
npm install
```
4. Start the local development blockchain:
```
ganache-cli
```
5. Compile and deploy the contracts:
```
truffle compile
truffle migrate --network development
```

## Usage Instructions
To interact with the smart contracts, you can use web3.js or ethers.js. Here are some examples:

### Using web3.js
```javascript
const Web3 = require('web3');
const web3 = new Web3('http://localhost:8545');
const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, contractAddress);

// Call a function
contract.methods.myFunction().call().then(console.log);

// Send a transaction
contract.methods.myFunction().send({ from: account }).then(console.log);
```

### Using ethers.js
```javascript
const { ethers } = require('ethers');
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('http://localhost:8545');
const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, abi, provider);

// Call a function
contract.myFunction().then(console.log);

// Send a transaction
const signer = provider.getSigner();
const contractWithSigner = contract.connect(signer);
contractWithSigner.myFunction().then(console.log);
```
