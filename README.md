## Description
This repository contains the smart contracts for the ETHkey protocol. The ETHkey protocol is designed to facilitate secure and efficient transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Cloning the Repository
To clone this repository, use the following command:
```
gh repo clone Setland34/ETHkey-1
```

## Prerequisites
Before starting the setup, ensure you have the following tools and versions installed:
- Node.js (v14.x or higher)
- npm (v6.x or higher)
- Truffle (v5.x or higher)
- Ganache CLI (v6.x or higher)

## Installing Dependencies
To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:
```
npm install
```

## Development Environment Setup
To set up the development environment, follow these steps:
1. Install Ganache CLI:
   ```
   npm install -g ganache-cli
   ```
2. Install Truffle:
   ```
   npm install -g truffle
   ```
3. Start Ganache CLI:
   ```
   ganache-cli
   ```
4. Compile the smart contracts:
   ```
   truffle compile
   ```
5. Migrate the smart contracts to the development network:
   ```
   truffle migrate --network development
   ```

## Testing Instructions
To run tests for the smart contracts, use the following command:
```
truffle test
```
To run tests with forked mainnet state, use the following command:
```
forge test --fork-url https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOURKEY
```

## API Documentation
The API documentation provides detailed information about the functions and methods available in the smart contracts. You can find the API documentation [here](link-to-api-documentation).

## Deployment Instructions
To deploy the smart contracts to different networks, follow these steps:
1. Configure the network settings in `truffle-config.js`.
2. Deploy the smart contracts:
   ```
   truffle migrate --network <network-name>
   ```

## Usage Instructions
To interact with the smart contracts using web3.js or ethers.js, follow these examples:

### Using web3.js
```javascript
const Web3 = require('web3');
const web3 = new Web3('http://localhost:8545');
const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, contractAddress);

// Example function call
contract.methods.exampleFunction().call()
  .then(result => console.log(result))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

### Using ethers.js
```javascript
const { ethers } = require('ethers');
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('http://localhost:8545');
const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, abi, provider);

// Example function call
contract.exampleFunction()
  .then(result => console.log(result))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```
