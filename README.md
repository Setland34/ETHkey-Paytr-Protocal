## Description
This repository contains the smart contracts for the Paytr protocol. The Paytr protocol is designed to facilitate secure and efficient transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Cloning the Repository
To clone this repository, use the following command:
```
gh repo clone Setland34/PAYTR-Private
```

## Usage Instructions
To use the Paytr protocol smart contracts, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
- Install the Truffle framework globally using `npm install -g truffle`.
- Install the Ganache CLI for local Ethereum blockchain testing using `npm install -g ganache-cli`.

### Deployment
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   gh repo clone Setland34/PAYTR-Private
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd PAYTR-Private
   ```
3. Install the project dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Compile the smart contracts:
   ```
   truffle compile
   ```
5. Deploy the smart contracts to the local blockchain:
   ```
   truffle migrate
   ```

### Interaction
To interact with the deployed smart contracts, you can use the Truffle console:
```
truffle console
```
In the console, you can call the functions of the smart contracts. For example:
```
const instance = await MyContract.deployed();
const result = await instance.myFunction();
console.log(result);
```
