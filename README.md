## Description
This repository contains the smart contracts for the ETHkey protocol. The ETHkey protocol is designed to facilitate secure and efficient transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Cloning the Repository
To clone this repository, use the following command:
```
gh repo clone Setland34/ETHkey-1
```

## Usage Instructions
### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
- Install Truffle and Ganache CLI globally using npm:
  ```
  npm install -g truffle
  npm install -g ganache-cli
  ```

### Deployment
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the Ganache CLI:
   ```
   ganache-cli
   ```
4. In a new terminal, compile and migrate the smart contracts:
   ```
   truffle compile
   truffle migrate
   ```

### Interaction
1. Open the Truffle console:
   ```
   truffle console
   ```
2. Interact with the deployed contracts using JavaScript. For example:
   ```javascript
   const instance = await Paytr.deployed();
   const result = await instance.someFunction();
   console.log(result);
   ```

### Detailed Usage Examples
#### Common Use Cases
- Example 1: Deploying a new contract
  ```javascript
  const MyContract = artifacts.require("MyContract");
  module.exports = function(deployer) {
    deployer.deploy(MyContract);
  };
  ```

- Example 2: Interacting with a deployed contract
  ```javascript
  const instance = await MyContract.deployed();
  const value = await instance.getValue();
  console.log(value);
  ```

#### Handling Errors and Exceptions
- Example: Handling a transaction error
  ```javascript
  try {
    const result = await instance.someFunction();
    console.log(result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Transaction failed:", error);
  }
  ```

## Installing Additional Dependencies
If your project requires additional dependencies, you can install them using npm. For example:
```
npm install <dependency-name>
```
Replace `<dependency-name>` with the name of the dependency you want to install.

## Testing Instructions
To run tests for the smart contracts, use the following command:
```
truffle test
```
This will execute the test scripts located in the `test` directory and display the results.

To run tests with a forked mainnet, use the following command:
```
forge test --fork-url https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOURKEY
```

## API Documentation
The API documentation provides detailed information about the functions and methods available in the smart contracts. Refer to the `docs` directory for the complete API documentation.

### Overview
The API allows you to interact with the smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides functions for querying data, executing transactions, and managing contract state.

### Examples
- Example 1: Querying contract data
  ```javascript
  const data = await instance.getData();
  console.log(data);
  ```

- Example 2: Executing a transaction
  ```javascript
  const receipt = await instance.setData(newValue);
  console.log(receipt);
  ```

### Authentication
If your API requires authentication, include the necessary headers or tokens in your requests. For example:
```javascript
const options = {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`
  }
};
const response = await fetch(apiUrl, options);
```

## Changelog
The changelog keeps track of changes and updates made to the repository. Refer to the `CHANGELOG.md` file for a detailed list of changes.
